o	nm65 that prints labels from o65 files

o	inc a -> ina, dec a -> dea (right now uses bare inc and dec)

o	VICE label file support

o	Smarter -X that can cope with non-block-aligned segment sizes (in reloc65)

o	The listing feature is not bug-free yet:
	- ca65 and other assembler compatibility pseudo-opcodes will be
	  listed as xa specific ones, not the original in the source
	  E.g. a CA65 ".scope" will appear as ".(" in the listing
	- The assembler has no pre-processor handling, so pp constants are
	  resolved at parse time. Thus they appear as their value
	  in the listing.
	- One situation is ".listbytes unlimited",
	  which will show as ".listbytes 0" in the listing
