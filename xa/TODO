o	nm65 that prints labels from o65 files

o	`-L' option for ldo65, such that globals can be suppressed,
	but KERNEL can be kept

o	inc a -> ina, dec a -> dea (right now uses bare inc and dec)

o	VICE label file support

o	Smarter -X that can cope with non-block-aligned segment sizes

o	The listing feature is not bug-free yet:
	- ca65 and other assembler compatibility pseudo-opcodes will be
	  listed as xa specific ones, not the original in the source
	  E.g. a CA65 ".scope" will appear as ".(" in the listing
	- The assembler has no constant handling, so constants are
	  resolved at parse time. Thus they appear as their value
	  in the listing. Only situation now is ".listbytes unlimited",
	  which will show as ".listbytes 0" in the listing
