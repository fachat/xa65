This is a directory of test suites for complex or pathological cases that
have been repaired (?) in the current version. It is primarily for internal
testing, but is here for your interest.

Starting with 2.3.6, you should not normally need to run these directly
unless 'make test' fails. If you do, use harness:

./harness -cc=... -cflags=... -make=... -tests=testdir,testdir,testdir,...

If -tests is omitted, all tests are run.
Don't run the makefiles directly, if they exist; they may not work properly.
If a Makefile is not present, then the test harness assembles "test.s" and
compares it with "ok".
