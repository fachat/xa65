This is an experiment. 

xa65 is a 6502 cross assembler, running on Unix (and Unix-alikes), and producing 6502 and 65816 code. It comes complete with a set of tools.

xa65 was originally authored by me, Andr√© Fachat, but currently and still xa65 is maintained by Cameron Kaiser at http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/ . 

In this experimental repository, I am mirroring Cameron's releases and I am working on fixes and changes that I may want to submit to Cameron.

These are the directories:

xa		- contains the main source. The master branch is the stable version


These are the current branches:

master		- stable branch, currently 2.3.5
listing		- experimental branch that adds ca65 compatibility features and assembler listing
